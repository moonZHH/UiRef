# APP UI Layout Snapshot

These are three eclipse projects.

UiRef is the main project and it depends on the soot framework.

The functionality of this project is to dynamically retrieve the UI layout of a running app.

To use the project, you just need to import the three eclipse projects into the eclipse IDE.

In the MainImpl.java, you need to explicitly change the values of the "apkRootDirectoryPath" variable.

Before running the project, you need to launch a Android emulator.
